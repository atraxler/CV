  Abstract                 = {Gender gaps on the most widely used conceptual inventories created by physics education researchers have been extensively studied. Most of the research exploring the consistent gender gaps has been performed at the student level using the total evaluation score; less research has been performed examining these assessments at the item level and this research has been predominately restricted to the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). Many studies have identified subsets of FCI items as unfair to either men or women. An item is fair if men and women of equal ability in conceptual physics score equally on the item. This study explored the item-level gender fairness of the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM). Classical test theory and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis were employed to examine item fairness. Fairness was investigated with four large post-test samples, two for the FMCE (n1=3016, n2=3719) and two for the CSEM (n1=2014, n2=2657). Men and women performed significantly differently on the majority of FMCE items but with no more than a small effect size. There were fewer items in the CSEM where men and women performed differently. Using DIF analysis, which assumes that overall test score is an accurate measure of ability, only one item in the FMCE demonstrated large DIF in both samples with that item unfair to women. One additional item showed large DIF in a single sample, also unfair to women. Only one item in the CSEM demonstrated large DIF. The item was unfair to men but this result was not consistent across all samples. The number of large DIF items identified in both the FMCE and the CSEM was substantially smaller than the number of large DIF items identified in the FCI by previous studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Many instructors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields are striving to create active learning environments in their classrooms and in doing so are frequently moving the lecture portion of their course into online video format. In this classroom-based study, we used a two group randomized experimental design to examine the efficacy of an instructional video that incorporates a human hand demonstrating and modeling how to solve frictional inclined plane problems compared to an identical video that did not include the human hand. The results show that the learners who viewed the video without the human hand present performed significantly better on a learning test and experienced a significantly better training efficiency than the learners who viewed the video with the human hand present. Meanwhile, those who learned with the human hand present in the instructional video rated the instructor as being more humanlike and engaging. The results have implications for both theory and practice. Implications for those designing instructional videos are discussed, as well as the limitations of the current study.},

  Abstract                 = {If you are White, male, cisgender, straight, and able-bodied, you can say something as simple as "I am a physicist" with relative ease. The more those descriptors are different, though, the more complex the story becomes in the minds of others, yourself, or both. A simple claim such as "I am a physicist" is more likely to be questioned by students or colleagues if a Black woman says it instead of a White man. The person who doesn't fit the expected image of the identity is questioned, pushed against, and continues to be invisible in images and representations of the field. One of these dimensions of invisibility is disability. Students with disabilities face extra barriers coming into STEM fields, on top of those that physics already takes pride in ("you must be this brilliant to enter"). Some of these barriers are institutional, as in labs that have been physically constructed to be accessible only to a narrow range of bodies. Some of the barriers are social or emotional, as students must navigate choices about whether to request accommodations and stand out, or to stay silent and continue at a disadvantage. Until recently, disability has been virtually absent from the physics education research literature. Our goal in this chapter is to introduce frameworks from disability studies that are relevant to physics education, including critical perspectives to integrate disability with other identity facets such as gender or race and ethnicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Discussion forums provide a channel for students to engage with peers and course material outside of class, accessible even to commuter and nontraditional populations. Forums can build classroom community and aid learning, but students do not always take up these tools. We use network analysis to compare three semesters of forum logs from an introductory calculus-based physics course. The networks show dense structures of collaboration that differ significantly between semesters, even though aggregate participation statistics remain steady. After characterizing network structure for each semester, we correlate students' centrality---a numeric measure of network position---with final course grade. Finally, we use a backbone extraction procedure to clean up "noise" in the network and clarify centrality-grade correlations. We find that more central network positions are positively linked with course success in the two semesters with denser forum networks. Centrality is a more reliable indicator of grade than non-network measures such as postcount. Backbone extraction destroys these correlations, suggesting that the noise is in fact signal and further analysis of the discussion transcripts is required.},

  Abstract                 = {Our team's objective was to develop a one-day activity for an interdisciplinary group of upper-level undergraduate students in science and mathematics fields. Fluid dynamics offers a variety of problems that touch many other fields, from which we selected the concepts of laminar and turbulent flow, and the transition between them, as our focus. Students were provided with "starter" demonstrations to highlight different regimes of fluid behavior, then devised their own experiments to investigate questions of particular interest. To fit with the activity setting at a graduate school recruiting event, we placed particular emphasis on the skills of experiment design and sharing results with an audience of peers. Here we discuss the materials, timeline, and assessments developed, as well as summarize students' progress toward our goals in the activity.},
